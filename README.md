# Market-Basket-Analysis
In this repository you can find two files, which are the notebook file prepared in Jupyter Notebook and the dataset used in the analysis. I would like to point out that the dataset was generated using ChatGPT. The analysis done is called ‘Market Basket Analysis’ or ‘Association Analysis’, which aims to discover item sets frequently purchased together. Obviously, the discovery of such item sets would be very beneficial for the businesses that sell those items. By taking into consideration such item sets, a business would be able to provide better advertising or sales promotion, which in turn would provide greater profit.
